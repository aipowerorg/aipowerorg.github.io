Above the **Category** section, you'll find two dropdown menus: **Provider** and **Model**.

### Choosing a Provider

In the **Provider** dropdown, you have two options: OpenAI and Google.

- **OpenAI**: Selecting OpenAI will allow you to use models like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5.
- **Google**: Choosing Google will give you access to models such as text-bison-001 and chat-bison-001.

When Google is selected as the provider, you need to add your Google API key.

Click on the "Add your Google API key" link and enter your key in the provided field.

Remember to save your key for the system to use it.

Similarly, for **Blogging**, a prompt might be *Write a blog post on how to effectively monetize a blog, discussing various methods such as affiliate marketing, sponsored content, and display advertising, as well as tips for maximizing revenue.*

Select a pre-built prompt or customize it according to your requirements.

You can also write your own prompt in the textbox provided.

With your prompt ready, click the 'Generate' button.

The AI will process your prompt and display the output on the right side of the Playground interface.
