# Headings

Adding headings to your content is an essential way to structure your article or blog post, making it more readable and navigable for your readers.

Our plugin offers three options for managing headings: 

- Number of Headings
- Heading Tag
- Outline Editor

In this tutorial, we will show you how to use each of these options with simple, easy-to-follow instructions.

## Number of Headings

To set the number of headings in your content:

- Go to **Settings - Content** in the plugin menu and find the **Headings** section.
- Enter a value between 1 and 15 in the **Number of Headings** field. For example, if you enter 5, the plugin will generate your content with 5 headings.
- Click **Save** to apply the changes.

## Heading Tag

To choose the appropriate heading tag for your content:

- Go to **Settings - Content** in the plugin menu and find the **Headings** section.
- From the dropdown list called **Heading Tags**, select your desired tag. Options range from H1 to H6.
- Click **Save** to apply the selected tag to your headings.

When you select a heading tag from the dropdown list, this tag will be applied to all headings in your content. Our plugin currently does not support assigning different tags to individual headings within the same content.

## Outline Editor

If you want to modify, delete, add, or sort your headings before generating content, you can use the Outline Editor:

- Go to **Settings - Content** in the plugin menu and find the **Headings** section.
- Enable the **Outline Editor** by checking the box next to it.
- Now, whenever you generate content in Express Mode, a popup window will appear where you can **add**, **modify**, **delete**, or **sort** your headings.

<img src={OutlineEditor1} width="700" />

- Now, head to Express Mode and try generating content. You'll notice a popup window appears, allowing you to add, delete, modify, or reorder your headings.

- Feel free to make any adjustments to your headings as needed.
- Once you're satisfied, click the **Generate** button to proceed with content generation.
- If you change your mind and want to edit your title or start over, simply click the "Cancel" button to exit the popup window and return to the previous screen.

By following these simple steps, you can easily customize the headings in your content to enhance readability and improve the overall structure of your content.
