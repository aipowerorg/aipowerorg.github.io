You can enhance your content by adding **anchor text** and a **call to action**.

Anchor text is a hyperlink that directs readers to another webpage or resource, while a call to action is a statement that encourages readers to take a specific action, such as signing up for a newsletter or making a purchase.

These features can help engage your readers and drive traffic to your website or other resources.

## Adding Anchor Text

To add anchor text to your content:

- Go to **Content Writer - Express Mode**.
- Navigate to the **Links** tab on the right side.
- Add your anchor text in the **Anchor Text** field.
- Add the target URL in the **Target URL** field.
- Click **Generate** and review the generated content.

<img src={Anchor} width="300" />

The plugin will search for the **first occurrence** of the anchor text in the AI engine's response and create a hyperlink to the target URL.

**If found**, it will create a hyperlink to the target URL.

The generated content will automatically be added to your article or blog post, with the anchor text hyperlinked to the target URL. You can edit or delete the content using the WordPress editor.

:::info

Anchor text is not guaranteed, as the plugin will only create a hyperlink if it finds the anchor text in the content generated by the AI. If the anchor text is not found, a hyperlink will not be created.

:::

Example:

Let say you are generating a content about "GPT Models" and your anchor text is: "Davinci" and your target URL is: https://aipower.org/davinci.

The plugin will look for the anchor text "Davinci" in the response from AI engine and create a hyperlink to the target URL.

If the anchor text is not found in the response, the plugin will not create a hyperlink.

## Adding Call to Action

- Go to **Content Writer - Express Mode**.
- Navigate to the **Links** tab on the right side.
- Add your call to action link in the **Call to Action Link** field.
- Choose the location of the call to action link from the dropdown menu (beginning or end of the content).
- Click **Generate** and review the generated call to action.

<img src={CTA} width="300" />

The plugin will automatically add the call to action to your content based on your location selection (beginning or end of the content), with the hyperlink directing the reader to the target URL. You can edit or delete the call to action using the WordPress editor.

Example:

Let say you are generating a content about "GPT Models" and your target call to action URL is: https://aipower.org.

The plugin will send a request to the AI engine to get a call to action for the URL. The response may look like this:

*"Are you interested in exploring the power and potential of GPT models? Look no further than AI Power! Visit our website at https://aipower.org to learn more and get started today!"*
