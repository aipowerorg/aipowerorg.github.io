# Keywords

You can add **specific keywords** to your content.

This can be useful if you want to ensure that **your content covers certain topics** or concepts in a more prominent way.

The effective use of keywords is essential for creating high-quality, SEO-friendly content.

By incorporating relevant keywords into your content, you can improve your search engine rankings, drive more organic traffic to your website, and better meet the needs of your target audience.

Our content writer offers three distinct features for managing keywords: 

- Add Keywords
- Avoid Keywords
- Make Keywords Bold

:::note

This is a Pro feature and requires an upgrade to access.

## Add Keywords

To add specific keywords to your content:

- Go to **Content Writer - Express Mode**.
- Navigate to the **Keywords** tab on the right side.
- Use a comma to separate keywords and add them to the **Add Keywords** field.

For example, if you want to cover the topics of "mobile phones" and "smartphones," you would enter "battery life, cost" as the keywords.

 When you enter keywords, we add an extra instruction to the prompt sent to the GPT model to produce content with those keywords. However, GPT models do not necessarily follow the instructions all the time. The inclusion of keywords depends on the GPT model and is not guaranteed. If you don't see your keywords in the generated content, it's probably because the GPT model did not adhere to your instructions.

## Avoid Keywords

To avoid certain keywords in your content:

- Go to **Content Writer - Express Mode**.
- Navigate to the **Keywords** tab on the right side.
- Use a comma to separate keywords and add them to the **Avoid Keywords** field.

<img src={AvoidKeywords} width="300" />

This will ensure that the specified keywords are not included in the generated content.

:::info

 When you enter keywords, we add an extra instruction to the prompt sent to the GPT model to produce content without those keywords. However, GPT models do not necessarily follow the instructions all the time. The exlusion of keywords depends on the GPT model and is not guaranteed. If you still see your keywords in the generated content, it's probably because the GPT model did not adhere to your instructions.

## Make Keywords Bold

To make your keywords stand out by making them bold:

- Go to **Content Writer - Express Mode**.
- Navigate to the **Keywords** tab on the right side.
- Put a tick in the checkbox next to **Make Keywords Bold**.
