# Custom Mode

Custom Mode is a feature within our plugin that allows users to generate content with **greater flexibility** compared to Express Mode.

While Express Mode provides one-click content generation, Custom Mode gives users the ability to customize all settings to create content tailored to their specific needs.

## How to Use Custom Mode

Go to the **Content Writer** within the plugin and switch to the **Custom Mode** tab.

### Step 1: Choose Your Title

- Go to the **Custom Mode** tab within the **Content Writer** plugin.
- On the left side, you'll find two radio buttons: **Topic** and **Use My Own title**.
- If you choose **Topic**:
    - Enter a topic (e.g., "mobile phones") in the text field below the radio buttons.
    - Click on **Suggest Titles**. Our plugin will retrieve title suggestions for the given topic.
    - A modal window will appear, displaying the suggestions.
    - Select one of the suggestions, modify it if needed, and click the **Use This** button.
    - The selected title will be appended to the text field.

- If you choose **Use My Own Title**:
    - The **Suggest Titles** button will be hidden.
    - Enter your desired title in the text field without receiving suggestions.
    - (Optional) Adjust the number of title suggestions you'd like to receive using the dropdown menu next to the "Suggest Titles" button (options: 3, 5, 7; 5 is the default).

- Use the dropdown menu to select the desired number of sections (options: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12; 4 is the default).
- The generated sections will be added to the **Sections** textarea, where you can modify, delete, or add sections as needed.

## Settings in Custom Mode

Settings are located on the right side of the Custom Mode tab, allowing users to adjust **AI engines**, **AI parameters**, **prompts**, and **templates** to meet their specific content generation requirements.

### Selecting AI Engine and Models

Custom Mode offers the flexibility to choose from different AI engines, each with its own unique models and configurations.

Here's a brief overview of the options available:

#### OpenAI

- When OpenAI is selected as the AI engine, a dropdown menu appears, allowing you to choose from a range of models.
- The models available under OpenAI include GPT-4 and various GPT-3 variations.
- OpenAI is set as the default engine because of its wide range of capabilities and general applicability.

#### Azure

- Selecting Azure from the provider list will prompt a new field labeled "Deployment".
- In this field, you need to input your specific Azure deployment details.
- To learn more about obtaining your Azure deployment, visit [this page](docs/ai-engine/azure-openai.mdx).
- Azure offers robust AI capabilities and is ideal for users who prefer Microsoft's ecosystem.

#### Google

- Choosing Google as the AI engine automatically sets Gemini Pro as the model.
- Currently, Gemini Pro is the only model supported for Google in our plugin.
- If you haven't set up your Google API key yet, please refer to [this page](docs/ai-engine/google.mdx). Once configured, you can utilize the full potential of the Custom Mode with Google's AI services.

### AI Parameters

You can modify the GPT model settings, including **model**, **temperature**, **top_p**, **frequency penalty**, **presence penalty**, **max tokens**, and the **best of** parameter.

- Navigate to the "AI Parameters" section in Settings.
- Adjust the GPT model settings as needed.

    - **Sections Prompt**: "Write [count] consecutive headings for an article about [title]"
    - **Content Prompt**: "Write a comprehensive article about [title], covering the following subtopics [sections]. Each subtopic should have at least [count] paragraphs. Use a cohesive structure to ensure smooth transitions between ideas. Include relevant statistics, examples, and quotes to support your arguments and engage the reader."
    - **Excerpt Prompt**: "Generate an excerpt for [title]. Max: 55 words."
    - **Meta Prompt**: "Write a meta description about [title]. Max: 155 characters."
