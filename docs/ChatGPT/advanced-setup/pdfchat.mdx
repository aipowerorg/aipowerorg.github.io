Once these steps are completed, go to your chatbot.

<img src={PDFchat} width="700" />

You will notice a PDF icon appearing next to the microphone button. This allows users to upload PDF files directly in the chat interface.

## Viewing Uploaded PDFs

As an admin, you have the ability to access and manage the PDFs uploaded by your users.

All user-uploaded PDFs can be found under the **ChatGPT - Uploaded PDFs** tab in your dashboard.

<img src={uploadedpdfs} width="700" />

From this tab, you can view all the PDFs that have been uploaded and embedded by users.

This is a convenient way to keep track of the documents being interacted with on your platform.

Moreover, you have the option to delete any of these PDFs if you no longer want to keep them in your index.

This gives you control over the content that remains accessible to your users through the chat interface.

:::tip

To maintain a clear distinction between your website content and user-uploaded PDFs, you can create separate bots for each type of content and assign each bot a different index.

By doing this, you can ensure that your chatbot accurately retrieves and delivers the appropriate information to your users.

This is particularly helpful if you do not want your website content to mix with the content from user-uploaded PDFs.

:::

By managing your user-uploaded content effectively, you can ensure that your chatbot continues to provide accurate and relevant responses, while maintaining the integrity and security of your platform.

## Clearing the PDF Session

Once a user uploads a PDF, the upload PDF icon will disappear and be replaced with a clear session button, represented by an "X" symbol.

This option is designed to allow users to clear their current PDF session and return to chatting with the website's native content.

<img src={pdfclear1} width="700" />

Let's walk through how this process works:

After a user has uploaded a PDF, they will interact with the content of the document in the chat interface. During this time, the upload PDF icon will not be visible.

If a user decides to clear the PDF session, they can simply click on the "X" button. This action will clear the current PDF session, removing any uploaded PDFs from the chat interaction. This step is important to ensure that the chatbot returns to addressing inquiries related to the website's native content.

<img src={pdfclear2} width="700" />

:::note
Clearing a PDF session does not delete the uploaded PDF from the system. It only removes it from the current chat interaction. The PDFs can still be accessed by the admin under the **ChatGPT - Uploaded PDFs** tab in the dashboard.
:::

Once the PDF session is cleared, the upload PDF icon will reappear, allowing users to upload a new PDF if they wish.

By providing users with the option to clear their PDF session, you can ensure that the chatbot interaction remains flexible and adaptable to the users' needs. Whether they're interacting with an uploaded PDF or chatting about the website's content, the user remains in control of the chatbot interaction.

:::tip

Additionally, a user can also clear the current PDF session by simply refreshing the page.

:::

Remember, managing your PDF sessions effectively is crucial for maintaining an efficient and user-friendly chatbot interface. It helps ensure that your chatbot provides accurate and relevant responses, while keeping the user experience smooth and intuitive.
