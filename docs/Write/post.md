## Post Attributes

-   **Type**: Choose whether to save the content as a `Post`, `Page`, or any other public custom post type available on your site.
-   **Author**: Select the WordPress user who will be assigned as the author of the post.
-   **Categories**: Assign one or more categories to the post. This option is available for post types that support categories.

## Status & Scheduling

These settings determine the visibility and publication time of the post.

-   **Status**:
    -   **Draft**: Saves the post as a draft for you to review later.
    -   **Publish**: Publishes the post immediately.
    -   **Pending Review**: Saves the post with "Pending Review" status.
    -   **Private**: Saves the post as private, visible only to logged-in users with sufficient permissions.
-   **Scheduling**: If you select `Publish` as the status, you can optionally set a future date and time. The post will then be scheduled to go live at that time.
