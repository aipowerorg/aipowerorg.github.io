## How to Purchase

Purchasing AI Power is a straightforward process. There are two ways you can upgrade to a Pro Plan:

Both methods are secure, and we ensure your data is protected throughout the transaction process. Once the purchase is completed, you'll have immediate access to all the features and benefits of your chosen plan.

## White Label Mode

Our [User Portal](/docs/getting-started/user-portal.md) offers builders, like agencies and freelancers, who work on client projects greater protection of their data and license through a special LICENSE SECURITY section available for every license.

By flagging a license as **White Labeled**, license owners can easily hide confidential information about their account and license:

This means that account details normally shown in the Account tab in the WP Admin will not appear after checking the **This license is activated on my client(s) site(s)** box.

Here’s what will be hidden when a license is set as white-labeled:

- User information
- Billing details and invoices
- License key
- Pricing page
- Add-on prices (if you sell add-ons)
- Contact Us page

Our License Firewall empowers license owners to control the websites that can activate their license or continue receiving updates.
