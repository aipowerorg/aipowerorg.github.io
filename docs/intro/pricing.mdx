Flag a license as **White Labeled** to hide confidential information:

When a license is white-labeled, the following information is hidden:

- User information
- Billing details and invoices
- License key
- Pricing page
- Add-on prices (if you sell add-ons)
- Contact Us page

Our License Firewall lets you control which websites can activate your license and receive updates.
