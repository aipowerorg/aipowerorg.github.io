## Priority Support

Paid plan users get access to a dedicated email channel for priority support with their questions and technical issues.

## Advanced Integrations & Features

-   **Ollama Integration**: Run AI models locally on your own hardware. Connect to any model served by Ollama for enhanced privacy, cost control, and offline capabilities. Learn more at [AI Providers](/docs/ai-providers#ollama-local-ai).

-   **Triggers**: Build complex, automated workflows for your chatbot using an event-based system. Create rules that perform actions (like sending a specific reply or calling a webhook) when certain events occur and conditions are met. Learn more at [Triggers](/docs/triggers).

-   **Realtime Voice Agent**: Enable live, low-latency, speech-to-speech conversations with your chatbot using OpenAI's Realtime API for a natural voice agent experience. Learn more at [Voice Agents](/docs/voice-features#realtime-voice-agent).

-   **File Upload for Context**: Allow users to upload files (PDF, TXT) directly into the chat window. The chatbot uses the file's content as context for the ongoing conversation. Learn more at [Context](/docs/context#file-upload).

-   **Embed Anywhere**: Deploy your chatbots on any external, non-WordPress website using a simple HTML snippet. This allows you to manage all your bots from one WordPress installation. Learn more at [Create & Manage Chatbots](/docs/chat#embed-anywhere-external-sites).

-   **PDF Download**: In addition to standard TXT downloads, the Pro version allows users to download their chat transcripts as formatted PDF files. Learn more at [Appearance](/docs/Appearance#download).

## Automation & Content

-   **Advanced Automation Sources**: Create content automatically from a wider range of sources in the **Automate** module, including RSS feeds, a list of URLs, and Google Sheets. Learn more at [Content Creation](/docs/content-creation).

-   **Automated Content Update**: Schedule a recurring task to automatically improve your existing posts or WooCommerce products. The AI can rewrite titles, update excerpts, and update content based on your custom prompts. Learn more at [Content Update](/docs/content-update).

-   **Advanced Content Indexing**: Gain fine-grained control over the data used to train your knowledge base. Select specific custom fields and taxonomies to include or exclude from the indexing process for each content type. Learn more at [Knowledge Base / Training](/docs/ai-training/intro#content-indexing-controls).

## Administration & Compliance

-   **Auto-Delete Logs**: Automatically delete old log entries from your database after a specified retention period. This helps manage database size and comply with data privacy policies. Learn more at [Logs](/docs/logs#auto-delete-logs-pruning).

-   **OpenAI Moderation**: Automatically filter user-submitted chat messages for harmful or inappropriate content using OpenAI's Moderation API. Learn more at [Security & Privacy](/docs/security-privacy#moderation).

-   **Consent Compliance**: Require users to agree to your terms and policies by displaying a consent box before they can interact with your chatbots. Learn more at [Security & Privacy](/docs/security-privacy#consent-compliance).
