# Twitter

You can now integrate Twitter with our plugin, allowing you to generate tweets directly from GPT agent.

## Requirements

For the Twitter module, you need to set up two cron jobs: one for generating Tweet and putting them in the queue and another for processing the queue.

**Queue Processor**:

```bash
* * * * * php /var/www/html/index.php -- wpaicg_cron=yes 
```

**Twitter**:

```bash
* * * * * php /var/www/html/index.php -- wpaicg_tweet=yes 
```

Learn how to setup a cron job [here](/docs/AutoGPT/gpt-agents#cron-job-setup).

You also need to have a Twitter account. This account will be used to send tweets.

## Setup

### Creating a Twitter App

To use the Twitter feature, you need to create a Twitter app in your Twitter Developer Portal and paste api your keys to the plugin.

Follow these steps:

- Go to the [Twitter Developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard).
- On the left menu, find and click on **Dashboard**.
- Next, click on **Create Project**. 

<img src={Dashboardnew} width="700" />

- On the page that opens up, enter a suitable name (for example: my awesome gpt bot) for your bot and hit **Next**.

<img src={NameApp} width="500" />

- Select **Making a bot** as use case.

<img src={usecase} width="500" />

- Enter a Description for your bot. You can use this: *"The aim of this project is to design and implement a Twitter bot that will serve to automate specific tasks on the Twitter platform, thus enhancing user interaction and engagement. This bot will be programmed to perform functions such as tweeting, retweeting, liking, following, and replying to tweets, based on predefined rules and triggers."*

<img src={describemin} width="500" />

- Now give a name to your app. You can use same name as your project.

<img src={nameappnew} width="500" />

- Congratulations, your app is now created!
- Now, copy the API key and API key secret that have been generated for your app.

<img src={apikeys} width="500" />

- Go to your WordPress dashboard, and navigate to the **AutoGPT - Twitter**. Here, paste your API key and API key secret into the respective fields. Note: At this point, we're not finished yet. We still need to get the access token and access token secret.

<img src={apikeys2} width="700" />

- Navigate back to the Twitter Developer portal and click on your app. Scroll down to find the **User authentication settings** section and click on the **Setup** button.

<img src={authsetup} width="700" />

- On the page that opens up, under **App permissions**, select **Read and Write**.

<img src={authsetup1} width="500" />

- In the **Type of app** section, select **Web App, Automated App or Bot**.

<img src={authsetup2} width="500" />

- In the **App info** section, you're required to enter a domain for **Callback URI**. It isn't critical what you enter here, but a valid domain is required by Twitter. You can enter any domain here, for example, "https://example.com".
- In the **Website URL** field, enter the same URL or any other valid URL. This is also required.
- You can leave other fields empty as they are optional. After you've filled all the required fields, click **Save**.

<img src={authsetup3} width="500" />

- Navigate to **Keys and Tokens** and click on the **Generate** button to generate your access token and secret.

<img src={authsetup4} width="500" />

- A popup window will open, displaying your access tokens. Copy the access token and access token secret.

<img src={authsetup5} width="500" />

- Go back to the **AutoGPT - Twitter** tab in your WordPress dashboard and paste the access token and access token secret into their respective fields.

<img src={authsetup6} width="500" />

- Click **Save** to finalize your settings.

- Congratulations! You've successfully set up the new Twitter feature for your AI Power WordPress plugin.

### Configuring Cron Jobs for Twitter

- Follow the steps outlined in this guide to [set up a Cron Job](/docs/AutoGPT/gpt-agents#cron-job-setup).
- Ensure that you include the specific PHP command for the Twitter job in your Cron Job configuration to make it functional.
- You can find your php command under Twitter tab.

<img src={CronSample} />

Your PHP command may vary depending on your server setup.

For the Twitter module, you need to set up two cron jobs: one for generating Tweet and putting them in the queue and another for processing the queue.

**Queue Processor**:

```bash
* * * * * php /var/www/html/index.php -- wpaicg_cron=yes 
```

**Twitter**:

```bash
* * * * * php /var/www/html/index.php -- wpaicg_tweet=yes 
```

Learn how to setup a cron job [here](/docs/AutoGPT/gpt-agents#cron-job-setup).

However, your command might differ.

This is how my Cron setup looks like.

<img src={CodeSample} />

Once the Cron Job setup is complete, you should see a message stating, “Great! It looks like your Cron Job is running properly. You should now be able to use the Twitter bot."

Additionally, all previously greyed-out fields will be activated, allowing you to proceed to the next steps.

### Blog2Tweet

Blog2Tweet is an automated feature that enables each published post on your WordPress site to be sent as a tweet.

To configure this, navigate to the **AutoGPT - Twitter** tab in your WordPress dashboard, and scroll down to the **Blog2Tweet** section.

<img src={Blog2Tweet} />

This feature has three configurable options:

- **Send Tweet For**: Here, you can select the post types that should trigger an automatic tweet. This includes standard posts, pages, and any custom post type. Simply check the box next to the post type to enable tweeting for that type.
- **Include Post Link**: Enabling this option will include a link to your post in the automatic tweet.
- **Prompt**: This is where you customize the text of the automatic tweet.

The default prompt is:

*"Write a compelling and engaging tweet in English that promotes a new blog post. The title of the blog post is `[post_title]`. The tweet should grab attention, introduce the topic and invite readers to click and read the post. Please remember to craft the tweet strictly within `[number]` characters."*

Above the text area is a dropdown called Template. Here you can select the tone of the automated tweet. Options include sarcastic, cheerful, humorous, professional, inspirational, and informative. When you select one of these options, the corresponding predefined prompt will appear in the text area.

Make sure the placeholders `[post_title]` and `[number]` remain in your custom prompt.

You can adapt the prompt to other languages by replacing **in English** with your preferred language.

### Twitter Writer

Twitter Writer is a feature that leverages GPT to compose and send tweets based on your specified keywords at predefined intervals.

<img src={TweetWriter} />

This feature also offers three configurable options:

- **Keywords**: Here, you enter the keywords that will inform the content of the tweets. These should be subjects that interest you, separated by commas (e.g., life, food, travel). The GPT agent will select a random keyword each time and generate a tweet on that topic.
- **Interval**: From the dropdown menu, select how often you want to send a tweet. The options range from every 1 hour to every 24 hours.
- **Prompt**: This is where you customize the text of the automated tweet.

The default prompt is:

*"Write a compelling and engaging tweet in English about `[keyword]`. Please remember to craft the tweet strictly within `[number]` characters."*

Sample tweet generated by GPT with pre-defined keywords:

<img src={SampleTweet} width="700" />

Above the text area, there's a dropdown menu titled Template. This allows you to choose the tone of the tweet. Options include a question, fact, opinion, sarcastic, cheerful, humorous, etc.

Ensure that the placeholders `[keyword]` and `[number]` are included in your custom prompt.

As with Blog2Tweet, you can adapt the prompt to other languages by replacing "in English" with your preferred language.

Following these steps will help you maximize the potential of the AI Power WordPress plugin's Twitter module, automating the process of keeping your Twitter followers updated and engaged.

## Auto Restart Failed Jobs

You can choose to automatically restart failed jobs after a specific amount of time or after a certain number of attempts.

To enable the restart feature, go to the **AutoGPT - Settings** tab.

<img src={Restart} width="700" />

- **Restart Failed Jobs After**: Set the amount of time after which the tool should attempt to restart a failed job. Available options: Do not restart, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 minutes.

- **Attempt up to a Maximum of**: Define the maximum number of times the tool should try to restart a failed job before giving up. Available options: 1 to 10 times.

By configuring these settings, you can ensure that your tweet generation process continues smoothly even if there are temporary issues with the OpenAI servers or if you run out of quota.

For example, if a bulk job fails due to unforeseen circumstances such as OpenAI servers being down or you are out of quota, the tool will automatically attempt to restart the failed job based on the settings you have selected.

## Monitoring

The queue feature in AutoGPT is a helpful tool that allows users to keep track of the progress of their content creation.

You can monitor the status of each your Tweet batch in the Queue tab.

<img src={Queue} />

There are seven fields in the Queue tab that give you information about each batch of content.

| Field    | Description                                                                                                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Batch    | The Batch field shows you the list of titles in that batch. It is clickable, and once you click on it, you can see the list of titles in that batch.                   |
| Status   | The Status field shows whether the batch is pending, cancelled, in progress, or completed.                                  |
| Source   | The Source field shows where the batch was created, whether in the Bulk Editor, CSV, Copy-Paste, RSS or Google Sheets feature.                |
| Duration | The Duration field shows how long it took to generate all the contents in that batch.                                       |
| Token    | Token field shows how many tokens were spent to generate the content.                                                       |
| Word Count | The Word Count field shows how many words are in that batch.                                                                   |
| Action   | The Action field provides a delete button to delete the batch if you no longer need it. Please note that deleting a batch will not delete the content that was generated. | 

With the Queue feature, you can easily keep track of the progress of your content creation and stay organized. You can also cancel a batch if it is taking longer than expected or if you no longer need the content.

:::info

Deleting a job from the queue will only remove the job from the queue and will not delete the content that was generated.
