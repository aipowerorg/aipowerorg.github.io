# Top_P

## What is Top_P?

An alternative to sampling with temperature is called **nucleus sampling**, in which the model only takes into account the tokens with the highest probability mass (as determined by the **top_p** parameter).

For example, a value of 0.1 means that only the tokens with the top **10% probability** mass are considered.

OpenAI generally recommends to **use either temperature sampling or nucleus sampling, but not both.**

You can adjust your **top_p** value in settings page of our plugin as shown below.

## Changing Top_P Settings

When our plugin is installed for the first time, it comes with **0.01** as the default Top_P value.

However you can change it from the **Top_P** field in the **AI Engine** tab.

Here are the steps:

- First, navigate to the plugin menu on your WordPress dashboard.
- Click on the **Settings** page and look for the **AI Engine** tab.
- Enter a new value in the **Top_P** field.

## Balancing Diversity in GPT Text Generation

The Top_P parameter is a control for the **diversity** of the generated text produced by GPT.

When generating text with GPT, the model produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each word in the generated text.

The Top_P parameter controls how many of the **highest-probability words are selected** to be included in the generated text.

Specifically, **it sets a threshold such that only the words with probabilities greater than or equal to the threshold will be included.**

The threshold is calculated by taking the Top P percent of the words with the highest probabilities.

For example, if top_p=0.9, then the threshold is set to the probability of the word that is in the **90th percentile** of the words with the highest probabilities.

The value of Top_P can be set between 0 and 1, where a lower value will result in more diverse generated text and a higher value will result in more repetitive or "safe" text.

- **Lower value: **More diverse generated text.
- **Higher value: **More repetitive or "safe" text.

When you increase the Top_P the model will tend to produce more **conservative** text because, with the threshold of probability, most probable outcomes will be considered, thus resulting in less diversity.

Also, with a higher top_p parameter, the model **may not take any risks in generating new texts** and instead, will tend to select the more **common/repetitive** words.

On the other hand, with a low Top_P parameter, the model will tend to generate more diverse text and may take risks by selecting less probable words. However, this may also increase the **risk of producing nonsensical** or **nonsensical sentences.**

In summary, the Top_P parameter allows to control the level of “**risk**” the model is willing to take when generating text. With a higher value, the model will tend to generate more repetitive text, and with a lower value, it will tend to generate more diverse text.
