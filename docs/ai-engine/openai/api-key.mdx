# API Key

## Bring Your Own Key Model

Our plugin operates on a *Bring Your Own Key* basis, which means it serves as a **bridge between your WordPress site and OpenAI**.

In order to use our plugin, you need to have an OpenAI account and purchase API credits from OpenAI.

With this approach, users are required to provide their own OpenAI API key to access the plugin's functionality. This ensures that users maintain full control over their API keys and guarantees access to the latest, most advanced language processing technology offered by OpenAI.

**Purchasing our plugin does not provide any credit from OpenAI**. When you buy our plugin, you gain access to the [pro features](docs/intro/pro.md) of the plugin, but it does not include any API credit. You will still need to purchase credit from OpenAI separately.

To generate an OpenAI API key, you will first need to sign up for an account on the OpenAI platform.

Here are the steps:

- Visit the OpenAI Platform sign-up page at [https://platform.openai.com/signup](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
- Fill in your personal information, including your full name, email address, and password.
- Read and accept the terms of service and privacy policy.
- Click on the **Create Account** button.
- You will receive an email from OpenAI containing an account activation link. Click on the link to activate your account.
- After activating your account, log in to the OpenAI Platform at [https://platform.openai.com/login](https://platform.openai.com/login).
- Click on the **API Keys** tab in the left-hand sidebar or visit [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) directly.
- Click on the **Create an API key** button.
- Enter a name for your API key. This name will help you identify the key later (e.g., "My First API Key").
- Click on the **Create** button.
- Your OpenAI API key will now be generated and displayed in the **API Keys** section. The key will be a long alphanumeric string, such as `sk_1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`.
- To update it, go to the **Settings - AI Engine** tab and paste your API key into the designated field in our plugin and hit **Save** button.

Please note that, OpenAI gives **free 5$ credit** for new users as a trial version. Once you run out of it, you will need to purchase more credit from them. 
You can check your usage from [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/usage). If you encounter the message *"You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details"* it indicates that you have exhausted your OpenAI quota and need to purchase additional credit from OpenAI.

Please note that having a paid ChatGPT Plus subscription does not automatically grant access to the OpenAI API. You will still need to purchase API credits separately to utilize the API features.
